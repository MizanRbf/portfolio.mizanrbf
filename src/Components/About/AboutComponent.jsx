          Hi! I’m{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Mizanur Rahman</span>, a
          dedicated student of <strong>Arabic Language and Literature</strong>{" "}
          at the University of Rajshahi, and an enthusiastic{" "}
          <strong>web developer</strong> with a strong focus on the{" "}
          <strong>MERN Stack</strong> — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and
          Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I’m enrolled in the{" "}
          <strong>Web Development program at Programming Hero</strong>, where
          I’ve built several real-world projects such as{" "}
          <em>task management systems</em>,{" "}
          <em>subscription-based service platforms</em>, and{" "}
          <em>freelance job marketplaces</em>. My development stack includes
          building <strong>responsive</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>user-friendly</strong> interfaces using{" "}
          <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, and modern UI
          tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career goal is to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>{" "}
          and contribute to dynamic <strong>remote teams</strong> across the
          globe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond coding, I enjoy <strong>Arabic calligraphy</strong>, exploring{" "}
          <strong>emerging technologies</strong>, and staying updated with the
          latest trends in development.
